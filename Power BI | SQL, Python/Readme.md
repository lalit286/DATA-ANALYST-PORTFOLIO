**Problem Statement: Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard**
**Background**

In the highly competitive pizza industry, understanding sales performance and customer preferences is crucial for strategic decision-making. The pizza sales data contains valuable insights that can help identify trends, optimize operations, and enhance marketing efforts. However, the current data is scattered and not easily accessible in a comprehensive, visual format.

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard that provides an intuitive and interactive visual representation of the pizza sales data. The dashboard will enable stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), analyze sales trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve business performance.

Centralize Data: Integrate and centralize all pizza sales data into a single Power BI dashboard.

Visualize KPIs: Display key performance indicators such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and total orders.

Trend Analysis: Provide daily and monthly trend analyses to identify patterns and fluctuations in sales.

Sales Breakdown: Offer a detailed breakdown of sales by pizza category and pizza size.

Top and Bottom Performers: Highlight the top and bottom-performing pizzas based on revenue, quantity sold, and total orders.

Interactivity: Ensure the dashboard is interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific data points for deeper insights.

**Scope**
The Power BI dashboard will include the following components:

* Revenue Overview

* Total Revenue

* Average Order Value

* Total Pizzas Sold

* Total Orders

* Average Pizzas Per Order

* Trend Analysis

* Daily Trend for Total Orders
